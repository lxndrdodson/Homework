Carta Case Study
Alexandra Dodson

Founded: July 6, 2012 by Henry Ward, Manu Kumar

Carta started as eshares, a way for venture backed companies to manage equity, issue securities, and track ownership via cap tables. Once they were able to move beyond replacing paper records, Carta sold as a monthly service offering appraisals of private companies to estimate fair valuations and issue common stock to determine strike price.

Carta continues to add services and one of their most notable is the launch of a fund administration product which helps venture capital firms manage portfolio stakes and interface with their investors and limited partners. Carta provides portfolio analytics, deal IRRs (Internal Rate of Return) and cash management. They help VCs distribute quarterly investor reports and integrate with third-party tax and payroll vendors.

In 11 rounds, Carta has raised $627.8M. Their latest round was completed on September 11, 2020 from a Series F. 57 investors funded Carta, including Sutton Capital and FinSight Ventures are the most recent investors. Carta has a post-money valuation in the range of $1B to $10B as of May 12, 2020.

Carta solves the problem of private investing platforms with higher barriers to entry. Grace period, stock exchange certification (paper), cost to access, initial investment. While public platforms have lower returns because of the accessibility. Their solution consolidates listing for ownership split from issuer to buyer via electronic shares, options, debt, derivatives and track ownership, resolutions, and shareholder information--the investment footprint. It borrows from the capabilities of a docusign to tag for approval and compliance, captable tracking. New issues, transfers, settlements, and issuer liabilities. Portfolio: the owners assets. Networks are Limited Partners who access membership at funds meaning more access to VCs cia the fractional ownership industry.

Carta sells to companies and reaches venture capitalists and limited partners as a result from there; private equity, private companies, public companies servicing new categories of assets--transfer agents and employee equity brokerages--real estate, more quickly held assets. Financial frameworks: utility, laying financial cables. See: bell telephone.

The fractional ownership industry is a percentage share of an expensive asset. Shares are sold to owners and usually, companies manage the asset on behalf of the owners who pay monthly/annual fees for the management plus variable fees. Venture capital is a $130B market.

Automation of dealflow is Carta’s uniqueness in Venture. It’s similar to learning python where we’re connecting databases and classifications. This is Carta’s process for its customers which allows Venture Capital to have more sensitive decision making because of time saved.

Venture capital, investment management. Carta supports trading of securities through streamlined processes of ownership exchange. Important trends include the iteration of products like theirs that are paid and for captable management. Gust, Pulley, Carta, Captable.io. Each one of these companies, except for one of them, is built using  HTML5, Google Analytics, and jQuery. It makes sense for this to be Pulley’s uniqueness because their core technology is their modeling tool, the details of which are not available for free on Crunchbase. Most of these companies are similar, Pulley recently raised $10M in funding, the round was led by Stripe. The modeling tool, designed by the Pulley team allows for what all of its competitors aim to offer, modeling and visualization of the captable, including future equity valuation for employees which is a real value for companies looking to scale by leveraging equity compensation.  Carta created a competitive alley for Shareworks by Morgan Stanley which has bolstered its fintech capabilities through captable management and acquired Solium Capital last year. Additionally, the finance giant also acquired E*trade this year which helps stabilize the market by offering young investors access to their brand.

Carta, and Stripe via its investment in the fintech ecosystem and payments, have made fintech systems more accessible worldwide. Carta has many global competitors which are fodder alone for venture capital prospects. This company has disrupted the industry and inspired change by continuing to inspire investors to do what they do best--if their last round of fundraising shows anything for it. Based on my observations (Crunchbase), Morgan Stanley is able to better insulate their client data which positively impacts by offering added security. Because of this, they are able to acquire larger clients. That said, Carta inspires entrepreneurship.

My advice to Carta: lean into diverse founders and find avenues to support their startups growth. Be it pitch competitions, or educational platforms like accelerators, these key content assets inspire cultural growth within their ecosystem and this is currently their uniqueness against a company like Pulley which is lead by a woman founder. Pitch competitions can help to showcase a company’s innovative, open presence, excitement and interest in growth by helping their customers attract fledgling founders. Pitch competitions are an entertaining way for growth and maturity stage companies to get to know the founders in their ecosystem and support its growth by inbounding new technologies. This service would utilize zoom or houseparty to allow founders to interact with investors towards dealmaking. 
This technology is appropriate for Carta because it requires its customers to interact with their customers and optimized networking is one of the ultimate benefits this solution offers.
